# Music Visualization App

Welcome to the **Music Visualization App**! This app takes audio inputs and generates dynamic, interactive visualizations. Below, weâ€™ll showcase the design drafts and the final implementation. Visit the live demo [here](https://example.com/).

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Drafts

### Visualization I: Turntable
This concept revolves around a rotating turntable design that reflects the rhythm, amplitude, and other audio effects:

**Key Elements:**
- Rotating vinyl representing playback speed (33/48 RPM).
- Wave and groove effects visualizing audio amplitude and dynamics.
- Controls for panning and volume adjustments.

### Visualization II: The Earth Dancing
A global visualization where the Earth rotates and reflects the frequency ranges:

**Key Elements:**
- Dotted world map overlaid on a sphere.
- Frequency mapping:
  - Low frequencies (bass): Africa.
  - Mid frequencies: Asia.
  - Treble (high frequencies): Europe & UK.

## ðŸš€ Final Implementation

Explore the appâ€™s **interactive visualizations** and see how the initial designs evolved into the final product. The website includes:
- Real-time audio-reactive animations.
- Customizable effects based on user inputs.
- Seamless integration of global and local visual elements.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
1. **Audio Input:** The app takes in real-time or pre-recorded audio.
2. **Processing:** Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), it extracts audio features (bass, mids, treble).
3. **Visualization:** Maps audio features to animations:
   - Turntable: Waveforms and rotations.
   - Earth: Rotations and global highlights.

Enjoy visualizing your music!
